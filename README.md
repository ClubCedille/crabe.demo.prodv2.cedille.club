# C.R.A.B.E. Website

The C.R.A.B.E. website represents the bicycle club at École de technologie supérieure. It uses the Grav CMS to manage content and pages. This also replaces the Wordpress system that was used for the old C.R.A.B.E. site.

## Getting Started
### Prequisites
* PHP (>= 7.3.6)
* Web Server

See the [Grav Docs](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/basics/requirements) for more information about setting up Grav and a web server (depends on your machine).

### Run Application

Generally speaking, the web server needs to be started to be able to access the website at https://localhost:8080.

The CMS can be accessed at https://localhost:8080/admin.
